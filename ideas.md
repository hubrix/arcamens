### Suggestion for maming groups

1) It is interesting to suggest the customer about naming groups(as it happens with github and naming repositories).
A good approach for naming groups consists of something like: Department->group name
or Department.group name.

2) the approach sonsists of relating the first name of the group to a set of other objects
that the group will be related to.


3) Use hipschat.com to chat over posts instead of implementing our own chat mechanism. It would
permit a high level of integration with bitbucket and hipschat and we could get customers happpy about it.
