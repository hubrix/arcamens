# History/Contributors

I have designed and implemented 90% of arcamens. Victor Porton https://github.com/vporton 
has designed the payment module in its first version. After a discussion we had agreed to switch to
a fork of mine aka django-paybills which is of much better design and stability. 

He also has helped me with discussing features, advices also some tests.

I would like to thank Victor Porton who has supported this project during one year 
financially when i ran out of money and became jobless under the promise of earning 50% of arcamens profit. 

This project only was possible due to Victor Porton financial and some specification discussion on
some features, the features were all proposed by me, Victor Porton had participation just in the criticism of such
features. 

The reasons behind arcamens being open sourced are Victor Porton mental stability regarding future technologies
used in arcamens and non professional behavior towards me. My financial state influenced such a decision as well.

Victor actually possesses the domain which i have registered some years ago https://www.arcamens.com. 
He has stolen me the domain i gave him the password to manage it then he transfered it as an attempt
of running arcamens business on his own. 

The arcamens was conceived by me and he is trying to take advantage of three years of my effort. 

The site https://www.arcamens.com is running a version of the actual repository, Victor Porton
is a man of low character it seems. I highly suggest companies to not use https://www.arcamens.com for non 
open source usage. Victor Porton would probably take advantage out of the information stored by companies there.

He has given me financial support for 12 months on the purpose of just trying to advantage out of my effort. He lied about many aspects
of the future of our business. 

I gave him 50% of the profit of arcamens and he promised me to help financially until arcamens were ready for production. 
He also said he would pay for the marketing of it. When he no longer needed me he thought he was going to run the business on 
his own then dropped the support. He removed me the access from his server also paypal account under the excuse that
he couldn't give me it due to security reasons. 

We discussed for some hours when he just removed me also from gitlab repositories
and said he would give me 50% of the profit when him got it and i should wait. He didn't expect that i would just open source it
because he knows i'm in a really bad financial position. 

Arcamens was initially developed on bitbucket, it has been a lot of effort put by me in it. I convinced Victor to pay
for gitlab services then he started to own arcamens repositories on gitlab. 

This is the old repository of arcamens at bitbucket. Everyone can see my commits there.
