# History/Contributors

I have designed and implemented 90% of arcamens. Victor Porton https://github.com/vporton 
has designed the payment module in its first version. After a discussion we had agreed to switch to
a fork of mine aka django-paybills. 

which now turns to be useless. He also has helped me with dialoging
about features, advices also automated/manual tests. 

I would like to thank Victor Porton who has supported this project during one year 
financially when i ran out of money and became jobless under the promise of earning 50% of arcamens profit. 

This project only was possible due to Victor Porton financial and specification help.

The reasons behind arcamens being open sourced are Victor Porton mental stability regarding future technologies
used in arcamens and non professional behavior towards me. My financial state influenced such a decision as well.

Victor actually possesses the domain which i have conceived some years ago www.arcamens.com. 
I'm not sure if he is going to keep a fork of arcamens or just join me in the actual approach. 

Victor Porton demonstrated at some point to have some set of ethical and moral assertions whose
acceptance by me was of hard effort. Such divergencies in naturity made me take the decision to open
source arcamens it was also necessary in order to warrant the authorship of arcamens.  

I hope he apologizes for his bad behavior soon so we can both get back our dialogues about my ideas
regarding arcamens and mindmip :)
