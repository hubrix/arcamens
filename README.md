# History/Contributors

I have designed and implemented 90% of arcamens. Victor Porton https://github.com/vporton 
has designed the payment module in its first version. After a discussion we had agreed to switch to
a fork of mine aka django-paybills. 

which now turns to be useless. He also has helped me with dialoging
about features, advices also automated/manual tests. 

I would like to thank Victor Porton who has supported this project during one year 
financially when i ran out of money and became jobless. 

This project only was possible due to Victor Porton financial and specification help.

The reasons behind arcamens being open sourced are Victor Porton mental stability altogether with 
his set of ethical and moral rules. It influenced a lot my actual financial scenary as well.
financial scenary.

Victor actually possesses the domain which i have conceived some years ago www.arcamens.com. 
I'm not sure if he is going to keep a fork of arcamens or just join me in the actual approach.
