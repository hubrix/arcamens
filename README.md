# History/Contributors

I have designed and implemented 90% of arcamens. Victor Porton https://github.com/vporton 
has designed the payment module in its first version. After a discussion we had agreed to switch to
a fork of mine aka django-paybills which is of much better design and stability. 

He also has helped me with dialoging about features, advices also some tests.

I would like to thank Victor Porton who has supported this project during one year 
financially when i ran out of money and became jobless under the promise of earning 50% of arcamens profit. 

This project only was possible due to Victor Porton financial and specification help.

The reasons behind arcamens being open sourced are Victor Porton mental stability regarding future technologies
used in arcamens and non professional behavior towards me. My financial state influenced such a decision as well.

Victor actually possesses the domain which i have conceived some years ago https://www.arcamens.com. 
He has stolen me the domain i gave him the password to manage it then he transfered it as an attempt
of running arcamens business on his own. 

The arcamens was conceived by me and he is trying to take advantage
of three years of my effort. The site https://www.arcamens.com is running a version of the actual repository,

Victor Porton demonstrated at some point to have some set of ethical and moral assertions whose
acceptance by me was of hard effort. Such divergencies in his nature made me take the decision to open
source arcamens it was also necessary in order to warrant the due credits of the work to me.
